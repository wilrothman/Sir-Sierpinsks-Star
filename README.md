# Sir-Sierpinskis-Star
### About
A submission to a [project hosted by the Berkeley EECS department](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa22/proj/scheme_gallery/). It uses a 3D game engine made from scratch using Scheme and a 2D turtle. The image depicts intersecting [Sierpinski triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle) of arbitrary fractal complexity in color-coordinated models and rotated at various angles. If I learned anything from this project, it is that I probably should not have rotated it at angles without pattern. 

### Contest
Unfortunately, I did not win the contest. It had dozens of impressive submissions and I am not upset about it-- I see it more as a learning opportunity and as inspiration to try harder than ever before.

### Files
`Screenshot of Project.png`: An image of the rendered, final project.
`contest-submission.scm`: Scheme file, source code.

### 02-16-24 Edit
Added a separate file for the Python code.
